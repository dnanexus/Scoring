# Calculates the "PCR bottlenecking coefficient" (PBC), a measure of
# library complexity.
#
# Let m_distinct be the number of genomic locations to which at least one
# read maps; let m_1 be the number of locations to which exactly one read
# maps. PBC = m_1 / m_distinct.
#
# Note that this differs somewhat from the "nonredundant fraction" (NRF)
# metric described in Landt et al. (2012), which is defined as "the ratio
# between the number of positions in the genome that uniquely mappable
# reads map to and the total number of uniquely mappable reads".
#
# This code assumes the mappings file has already been filtered for only
# uniquely mappable reads.
#
# The input is a file containing mappings in either SAM or ELAND format.
# ELAND format is detected by the input filename ending in '_eland.txt'. If
# this suffix is not present, SAM format is assumed.
